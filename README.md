If you are already familiar with this helper, just download the archive you needed.

So, what does it do?

Imagine that you have file like these in `Media` folder.

And if you want to play multiplayer with your mates you need all time to move them from this folder before running the game and then return your files back. It's pretty annoying. This tool does it for you. But your input is required in the begining.

Both arhive files contain `Config.txt`. First row is a path that should lead to the game folder only (there is already an example path). Second row is a timeout, if your PC runs game pretty slow and it takes more than 10 seconds - replace the timeout to yours.

When you are done and run the `.exe` file from your archive and it will do the magic for you. It moves files in `Media` folder to `levels` folder, launches the game, moves files back. And voila, you can play it with your mates without manual file manupulation.
